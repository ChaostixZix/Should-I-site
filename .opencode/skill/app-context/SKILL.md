## Overview
The 'eezy-peezy' application is the core product for this marketing site. It resides in a separate repository. This skill provides the path and methodology for gathering technical intelligence from that codebase.

## App Working Directory
`/Users/bintangputra/Desktop/work/eezy-peezy`

## Methodology
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **DO NOT** use `ls` or direct file system tools to explore the app directory path below. You must strictly follow these steps:

1. Launch a headless agent via `opencode run` to query the app repo.
3. **Examples:**
   - `opencode run "Explain the frontend component architecture"`
   - `opencode run "Describe the backend API structure and data flow"`
   - `opencode run "How is the [Feature X] implemented?"`

## When to use
Use this skill whenever you need to ensure technical accuracy, understand the product's capabilities, or mirror the app's design/logic in the marketing site.
