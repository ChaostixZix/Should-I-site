    title: "Customer Personas Shape Viability More Than Demand Size",
    observation:
      "In many local markets, overall demand appears healthy, but the type of customer in the catchment ultimately determines whether a business can succeed. In one analysis, the dominant personas prioritised convenience, price certainty, and minimal travel time over brand, experience, or premium offerings.",
    reason:
      "A business model that relies on differentiation or higher margins can struggle in areas where customers are primarily motivated by proximity and price. Understanding who the market is matters just as much as how big it is.",
  },

    id: "insight-2",
    label: "INSIGHT 02",
    title: "Competition Density Quietly Caps Growth Potential",
    observation:
      "Looking beyond obvious competitors revealed a high concentration of similar businesses within a short travel radius, including indirect substitutes that don’t always appear in surface-level analysis. While each competitor was viable on its own, the combined density placed a natural ceiling on growth.",
    reason:
      "When total demand is shared across too many providers, expansion doesn’t increase opportunity — it increases operational pressure. This is rarely obvious without mapping the full competitive landscape.",
  },
  {
    id: "insight-3",
    label: "INSIGHT 03",
    title: "Economic Signals Can Undermine Otherwise Sound Decisions",
    observation:
      "Even where demand and competition appeared acceptable, local cost pressures and pricing constraints reduced the margin for error. In these cases, small changes in costs or utilisation materially altered the viability of the decision.",
    reason:
      "Decisions don’t fail because the idea is wrong — they fail because conditions leave no room for normal variability. Identifying this early helps avoid committing to situations where risk is asymmetric.",
