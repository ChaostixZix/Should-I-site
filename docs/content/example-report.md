## SEO Framing
**H1:** What a Should-I Report Actually Shows You  
**Meta description:** See how Should-I analyses real demand, competition, and risk — before you invest or expand.

---

## Intro Section

### Heading
**This is not a generic market summary.**

### Copy
A Should-I report is designed to answer one question:

> “If I go ahead with this decision, what am I *not* seeing right now?”

Below are examples of the kinds of insights owners receive.

---

## Insight 1 — Catchment Reality

### Heading
**Who actually lives within reach of your business matters more than foot traffic.**

### Example Insight
In one recent analysis:
- **78% of the local catchment were classified as “Convenience Pragmatists”**
- Price sensitivity was high
- Travel tolerance was low

**Implication:** Premium positioning would struggle regardless of marketing spend.

---

## Insight 2 — Competitive Saturation

### Heading
**Competition density quietly caps your upside.**

### Example Insight
Within a 10-minute drive:
- 11 direct competitors
- 4 offering aggressive price discounting
- Flat population growth over five years

**Implication:** Expansion increases operational risk without increasing total demand.

---

## Insight 3 — Economic Viability

### Heading
**Revenue potential is only half the equation.**

### Example Insight
Even with optimistic assumptions:
- Margins compressed below sustainable thresholds
- Rising fixed costs absorbed most growth

**Implication:** The decision wasn’t “bad” — it was mistimed.
