## Problem Section

### Heading
**The most expensive mistakes usually feel reasonable at the time.**

### Copy
Most business failures don’t come from bad ideas. They come from blind spots — important constraints that weren’t visible early enough.

For example, a location can look viable on paper, but quietly fail once travel tolerance, competitor clustering just outside the visible strip, or local pricing sensitivity are properly understood.

Should-I exists to surface that information *before* you commit.

## Solution Section

### Heading
**Should-I gives you clarity before you decide.**

### Steps
1. You tell us about your business and decision.  
2. We analyse demand, competition, catchment behaviour, and economics.  
3. You receive a clear, decision-ready report — not a dashboard — explaining what the data means and why it matters for your decision.  
4. You decide your next move with confidence.

We don’t tell you what to do.  
We show you what’s true.

## Industries Section

### Heading
**Built for specific industries — because context matters.**

### Industries
- **Laundromats** — demand, saturation, pricing pressure, location viability  
- **Dental practices** — patient access, competition, growth constraints  

Each industry is analysed differently. Generic tools fail here.
