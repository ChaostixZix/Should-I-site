## What We Are

ShouldI is an AI-powered business intelligence platform that helps laundromat owners and entrepreneurs make confident business decisions backed by real data and local market analysis.

We turn the complex process of validating a business location, understanding your competition, and assessing your business health into simple, actionable reports.

## The Problem We Solve

Opening or expanding a laundromat is a significant investment. Most owners make these decisions based on:

- Gut feelings
- Outdated advice
- Expensive consultants ($5,000-$15,000 per report)
- Generic industry reports that don't reflect their specific location

**ShouldI changes this.** We provide location-specific, data-driven intelligence that was previously only available to large franchises and well-funded investors.

## Who We Serve

- Entrepreneurs considering opening a laundromat
- Existing laundromat owners looking to expand or relocate
- Investors evaluating laundromat opportunities
- Business owners wanting to understand their competitive position

3. **AI-Powered Insights** — Our AI analyzes thousands of data points and delivers clear, actionable narratives written for business owners, not analysts.

4. **Competitor Visibility** — See exactly who you're competing against, their strengths, weaknesses, and customer sentiment.

## The Value We Deliver

### Before ShouldI
- "I think this location is good because there's a lot of apartments nearby"
- "My competitor seems busy, so there must be demand"
- "I'm not sure if I'm pricing right"

### After ShouldI
- "76% of residents within walking distance are renters — my target market"
- "There are 20 competitors within 2km, but most have poor reviews for cleanliness — I can differentiate on quality"
- "My digital presence score is 62/100 — I'm losing customers to competitors with better Google visibility"
